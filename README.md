# Webpack configurado
".gitignore" at the beginnig the project.

after 
```
git init 
```
```
git commit -m "init" 
```
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/raulgfDev/webpack-init.git
```
```
git branch -M main
```
```
git push -u origin main
```

from here, it is defined alredy 'origin' in remote repository  ```git push```

```npm init -y``` = without question.

```npm run build``` = it create "dist" directory.

rr = "webpack.config.js" mode: ‘development’.

```npm start```   not neccesary with ‘start’ the word ‘run’.

webpack-server stop with ctrl+c en mac.

two files css, i. styles = global. ii. import in componets.js

two ways charge imgs i. import in componets.js ii. lib of webpack = copyPuglin.

two webpack.config files i.Dev ii.Prod, rr dev file is the same when webpack-server.

```npm install``` for the "node_module" directory, take like model the dependencies of "package.json" file.
Relation with .gitignore that applies over "node_module" and "dist" directories.

Github pages, necessary rename 'dist' to 'docs' (with this, avoid .gitignore), afterwards git add, commit and push. Finally, go to option in github pages.
